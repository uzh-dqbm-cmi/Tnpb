# Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ“”:

- run `models_trainvaltest_v2.ipynb` to train and evaluate models
- run `models_inference_v1.ipynb` to run the trained models (i.e inference mode).
  - trained models ( `FFN`, `RNN`, `CNN`, `Transformer` based) are found under `output` directory 
- run `user_sample_inference.ipynb`  to test out on your sample data, the current example test file is: data/Endogenous_spacers_TnpB_list.csv.  Predicted output for the test samples are saved under `output` directory
